In geometry, an orthotope[1] (also called a hyperrectangle or a box)
is the generalization of a rectangle for higher dimensions, formally
defined as the Cartesian product of intervals.

A three-dimensional orthotope is also called a right rectangular prism,
rectangular cuboid, or rectangular parallelepiped.
